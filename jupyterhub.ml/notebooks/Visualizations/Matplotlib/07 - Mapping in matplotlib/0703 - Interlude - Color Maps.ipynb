    "## Create a Color Mapper\n",

    "We'll need a way of mapping unemployment rates to hot and cold colors, and what we really want is something with a super simple interface, i.e., we just want to call it and pass in a value and get back a color. Unfortunately, we just can't grab a color map from matplotlib and pass in an unemployment rate. The problem with doing this is that a color map expects a float value between 0 and 1 and our data ranges from roughly 2-30. So, every value in our data falls outside of the range of the color map, and so we end up with a map that is just black across all counties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a color map also supports passing in integer values, and it maps those values to one of 256 colors. Given this option, we could simply call `int` on each value before passing it into the color map, but unfortunately, this creates a new problem. Since our data consists of values between 2 and 30, all of our values are on the low end of the spectrum when compared to the color map's range of 0-255. With this method, we end up with an extremely \"watered down\" map where all of the counties look a nearly identical shade of light yellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to both of these problems is to normalize each unemployment rate before passing it into our color map. Fortunately, matplotlib provides the `matploltlib.colors.Normalize` class to make this bit extremely easy. But, as I mentioned above, we want a simple interface that allows us to pass in a value and get a color. One way to accomplish this is through a callable object that encapsulates the creation of the normalization function. Again, matplotlib provides what we need to make this really easy. The `pyplot.cm.ScalarMappable` class is a mixin class for adding color map functionality to custom classes. We use this class below to create our `HeatMapper` helper class.\n",
