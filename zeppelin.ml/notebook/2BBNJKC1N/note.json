Later on that night, i laid there thinkin\u0027 back Thought \u0027bout a couple long-lost summers I didn\u0027t know whether to cry or laugh If there was ever anybody deserved a ticket to the other side It\u0027d be that sweet old man who looked me in the eye, said  (Chorus) I raise my hands, bow my head I\u0027m finding more and more truth in the words written in red They tell me that there\u0027s more to life than just what i can see  I can\u0027t quote the book The chapter or the verse You can\u0027t tell me it all ends In a slow ride in a hearse You know I\u0027m more and more convinced The longer that i live Yeah, this can\u0027t be No, this can\u0027t be No, this can\u0027t be all there is  (Chorus) When I raise my hands, bow my head I\u0027m finding more and more truth in the words written in red They tell me that there\u0027s more to life than just what i can see I believe Oh, I I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe  \nMartina McBride - Concrete Angel\tShe walks to school with the lunch she packed Nobody knows what she\u0027s holdin\u0027 back Wearin\u0027 the same dress she wore yesterday She hides the bruises with linen and lace The teacher wonders but she doesn\u0027t ask It\u0027s hard to see the pain behind the mask Bearing the burden of a secret storm Sometimes she wishes she was never born  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can\u0027t rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she\u0027s loved Concrete angel  Somebody cries in the middle of the night The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate When morning comes it\u0027ll be too late  [Repeat Chorus]  A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot  [Repeat Chorus]\nJosh Turner -

You, I hear you\u0027re doing fine. Seems like you\u0027re doing well as far as I can tell. Time is leaving us behind, (time _ leaving us behind) another week has passed and still I haven\u0027t laughed yet.

Don\u0027t you have the slightest feelings left for me? Maybe that\u0027s just your way of dealing with the pain, forgetting everything between our rise and fall like we never loved at all.  Did you forget the magic? Did you forget the passion? Oh, and did you ever miss me, and long to kiss me? Oh baby, baby.

Thought she might do some cryin\u0027: lose some sleep at night. But he had no idea, when he hit the road, That without him in her life, she\u0027d let herself go. Let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty. When he said he didn\u0027t love her no more, She let herself go.  She poured her heart an\u0027 soul into their three-bedroom ranch. Spent her days raisin\u0027 babies, ironin\u0027 his pants. Came home one day from the grocery store and found his note, And without him there to stop her, she let herself go.  Let herself go on her first blind-date: Had the time of her life with some friends at the lake. Let herself go, buy a brand new car, Drove down to the beach he always said was too far. Sand sure felt good between her toes:  She let herself go on a singles cruise, To Vegas once, then to Honolulu. Let herself go to New York City: A week at the Spa; came back knocked-out pretty. When he said he didn\u0027t love her no more, She let herself go.  To Vegas once: Honolulu, New York City. Came back knocked-out pretty.    \nTrace Adkins - Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\tTurn it up some Alright boys, this is her favorite song You know that right So, if we play it good and loud She might get up and dance again Ooh, she put her beer down Here she comes Here she comes Left left left right left Whoo Husslers shootin\u0027 eightball Throwin\u0027 darts at the wall Feelin\u0027 damn near 10 ft. tall Here she comes, Lord help us all Ol\u0027 T.W.\u0027s girlfriend done slapped him outta his chair Poor ole boy, it ain\u0027t his fault It\u0027s so hard not to stare At that honky tonk badonkadonk Keepin\u0027 perfect rhythm Make ya wanna swing along Got it goin\u0027 on Like Donkey Kong And whoo-wee Shut my mouth, slap your grandma There outta be a law Get the Sheriff on the phone Lord have mercy, how\u0027s she even get them britches on That honky tonk badonkadonk (Aww son)  Now Honey, you can\u0027t blame her For what her mama gave her You ain\u0027t gotta hate her For workin\u0027 that money-maker Band shuts down at two But we\u0027re hangin\u0027 out till three We hate to see her go But love to watch her leave With that honky tonk badonkadonk Keepin\u0027 perfect rhythm Make ya wanna swing along Got it goin\u0027 on Like Donkey Kong And whoo-wee Shut my mouth, slap your grandma There outta be a law Get the Sheriff on the phone Lord have mercy, how\u0027s she even get them britches on With that honky tonk badonkadonk (Ooh, that\u0027s what I\u0027m talkin\u0027 bout right there, honey)  We don\u0027t care bout the drinkin\u0027 Barely listen to the band Our hands, they start a shakin\u0027 When she gets the urge to dance Drivin\u0027 everybody crazy You think you fell in love Boys, you better keep your distance You can look but you can\u0027t touch That honkey tonk badonkadonk Keepin\u0027 perfect rhythm Make ya wanna swing along Got it goin\u0027 on Like Donkey Kong And whoo-wee Shut my mouth, slap your grandma There outta be a law Get the Sheriff on the phone Lord have mercy, how\u0027s she even get them britches on That honky tonk badonkadonk  That honky tonk badonkadonk Yeah, that honky tonk badonkadonk  (That\u0027s it, right there boys, that\u0027s why we do what we do It ain\u0027t for the money, it ain\u0027t for the glory, it ain\u0027t for the free whiskey It\u0027s for the badonkadonk)\nMontgomery Gentry - Gone\tThis ain\u0027t no temporary, typical, tearful good-bye, uh uh uh This ain\u0027t no breakin\u0027 up and wakin\u0027 up and makin\u0027 up one more time, uh uh uh This is gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone) gone Gone like a freight-train, gone like yesterday Gone like a soldier in the civil war, bang bang Gone like a \u002759 Cadillac Like all the good things that ain\u0027t never coming back She\u0027s gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone) gone, she\u0027s gone  This ain\u0027t no give it time, I\u0027m hurtin\u0027 but maybe we can work it out, uh uh uh Won\u0027t be no champagne, red rose, romance, second chance, uh uh uh This is gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone) gone  Gone like a freight-train, gone like yesterday Gone like a soldier in the civil war, bang bang Gone like a \u002759 Cadillac Like all the good things that ain\u0027t never coming back She\u0027s gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone) gone She\u0027s gone  She\u0027s gone (gone) gone (gone) gone (gone) gone, she\u0027s gone  Gone like a freight-train, gone like yesterday Gone like a soldier in the civil war, bang bang Gone like a \u002759 Cadillac Like all the good things that ain\u0027t never coming back She\u0027s gone (gone) she\u0027s gone (gone) she\u0027s gone (gone) she\u0027s gone She\u0027s gone  Gone like a freight-train, gone like yesterday Gone like a soldier in the civil war, bang bang Gone like a \u002759 Cadillac Like all the good things Well, she\u0027s gone  Long gone, done me wrong Never comin\u0027 back, my baby\u0027s gone Lonely at home, sittin\u0027 all alone She\u0027s packed her bags and now she\u0027s gone Never comin\u0027 back, she\u0027s gone No no never, no no never, no never comin\u0027 back\nZona Jones - Two Hearts\tI was born a dreamer, seemed like every day my mind came up with something new.
